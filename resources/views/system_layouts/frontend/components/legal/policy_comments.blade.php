        <p class="text-black">
            We welcome all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.<br/><br/>

            However, we will NOT condone the following:
        <ul>
            <li>- Racism (including offensive comments based on ethnicity and nationality)</li>
            <li>- Sexism</li>
            <li>- Homophobia</li>
            <li>- Religious intolerance</li>
            <li>- Cyber bullying</li>
            <li>- Hate speech</li>
            <li>- Derogatory language</li>
            <li>- Comments inciting violence.</li>
        </ul>

        We ask that your comments remain relevant to the articles they appear on and do not include general banter or conversation as this dilutes the effectiveness of the comments section.<br/><br/>

        We strive to make this community a safe and welcoming space for all.<br/><br/>

        We reserve the right to:
        <ul>
            <li>- Remove any comments that do not follow the above guidelines; and,</li>
            <li>- Ban users who repeatedly infringe the rules.</li>
        </ul>

        Should you find any comments upsetting or offensive you can also flag them and we will assess it against our guidelines.<br/><br/>

        We are constantly reviewing our comments policy in order to create an environment conducive to constructive conversations.
